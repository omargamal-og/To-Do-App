# 📝 To-Do App

A simple and responsive **To-Do List** web app that helps you manage daily tasks easily.  
Users can **add**, **complete**, **delete individual tasks**, or **delete all tasks** at once.  
All data is saved automatically in the **browser’s localStorage**, so your tasks stay even after refreshing the page.

## 💡 Future Improvements

Here are some ideas to make the To-Do App even better in the future:

- 🕹️ **Add task filters** — show only completed or pending tasks  
- 🗂️ **Add categories or tags** — group tasks by type (Work, Study, Personal, etc.)  
- ⏰ **Add due dates & reminders** — help users manage deadlines  
- 🌓 **Add dark / light mode** — allow theme switching for better UX  
- 🔄 **Add edit feature** — let users update existing tasks  
- ☁️ **Sync with a backend (e.g., Firebase)** — save tasks online and allow login  
- 📱 **Improve mobile UI** — make layout more touch-friendly  
- 🧭 **Add drag-and-drop ordering** — let users rearrange tasks easily
